1. Create a list that contains all the even numbers between 1 and 299.

    list = [x for x in range(2,300,2)]

or we could do...
    list=[]
    for x in range(1,300) :
        if x%2==0 : 
            list.append(x)


2. Iterate through the previously created list and print first the length of the list then all the squared values of the list.

    print('The length of the even numbers list : ', len(list) )
    print('\nthe squared values of the list : \n', [x**2 for x in list]) 


3. In one line check if 57 is in the list using one line of python.
    print('\nthe number 57 is in the list : ', 57 in list)
