#  1. Write a Python class named Rectangle constructed by a length and width and a method which will compute the area of a rectangle.

class Rectangle :
    def __init__(self,length,width) :
        self.length= length
        self.width = width
    
    def area(self) :
        return self.length* self.width



# 2. Create a Vehicle class with max_speed and mileage instance attributes.

class Vehicle :
    def __init__(self,max_speed,mileage) :
        self.max_speed= max_speed
        self.mileage= mileage


# 3. Create a Vehicle class without any variables and methods.

class Vehicle_empty :
    pass

# 4. Create a child class Bus that will inherit all of the variables and methods of the Vehicle class.

class Child_class_bus(Vehicle) :
    def __init__(self, max_speed, mileage) :
        super().__init__(max_speed, mileage)
